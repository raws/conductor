Conductor is a [Minecart Mania](http://wiki.afforess.com/Minecart_Mania-Plugin) plugin to help you disembark at the right stop.

Conductor is inspired by [DjDCH](http://forums.bukkit.org/members/djdch.1819/)'s [NextStation](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/mech-nextstation-0-1-1-your-favourite-stations-announcement-system-556.6572/). I wanted the ability to debark at _any_ upcoming station, and to use natural-reading signs to do so.

### Installation and usage

Conductor requires [Minecart Mania](http://wiki.afforess.com/Minecart_Mania-Plugin) Core. Simply drop `MinecartManiaConductor.jar` into your [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) server's `plugins` directory.

Conductor exposes one simple command. To set your minecart destination, use:

    /to <destination>

Where `<destination>` is the name of the station you'd like to debark at. Station names may be partial, and are case insensitive. For example, `/to gaf` will match the station "Fort Gafley".

To clear your destination, use `/to` without any parameters.

To create a station, place rail on top of a log block. Adjacent to the log (within a two-block radius in all directions), place a sign which looks like:

     -----------------
    |                 |
    |  Wheaties Line  |
    |   Fort Gafley   |
    |                 |
     -----------------
           |  |

Any signs with a "line" identifier (`/.*line/i`) will be matched against your destination. If a match is achieved, your minecart will be stopped, you will be ejected, and the minecart returned to its owner. Otherwise, you will continue rolling on down the line!
